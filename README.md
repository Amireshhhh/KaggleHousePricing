This is my first ever notebook and code that I submitted for Kaggle House Pricing competition.
It consists of basic EDA, preprocessing the data and feed it to bunch of non-linear models for regression purposes. This is my first ever hands on experience in Machine Learning and Data Science problems and tasks.
The competition was just for educational purposes and during my time of submission I ranked among top 20% of all participants.
